# ECommerce-with-React-thirdModuleProyect
Basic E-commerce made with ReactJS

Although the project has been delivered, there are plans to improve it.

This was my first web app using ReactJS.

How to see it?

    1. Download/clone the repository.
    2. Open the terminal and navigate to the repository location.
    3. Run "npm install" in your terminal.
    4. Run "npm run dev" in your terminal.

Project Info:

    -This project fetches data from FakeStoreApi's api,
    specifically from this endpoint: "https://fakestoreapi.com/products?limit=30",
    it retrieves 30 products and displays them on the page.

    -You can click on a product to expand its information and show buttons to add 
    it to the cart or wishlist. In both cases, you can remove products. 
    In the cart, you can also purchase them, and upon successful purchase,
    the cart is emptied.

    -The application also features a search bar for products.
